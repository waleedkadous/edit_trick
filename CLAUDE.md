# Edit Trick Project - Claude Preferences

## Project Overview
- This project demonstrates the "edit trick" for efficient document processing with LLMs
- Focus on demonstrating the efficiency gains compared to the traditional approach
- Provide clear benchmarks showing token usage and performance differences

## Implementation Standards
- Follow Python best practices with type hints throughout
- Use modular design to separate different components
- Implement both approaches (full document and edit trick) for comparison
- Include thorough error handling for API calls and JSON parsing

## Python Conventions
- Use Typer for the command-line interface
- Store any temporary files in a 'tmp' directory
- Follow the src-layout Python package structure
- Set PYTHONPATH to src/ when running modules

## Documentation
- Include clear examples in the README.md
- Document the algorithm and approach used in the edit trick
- Provide sample usage and benchmarking results
- Explain the advantages in terms of token efficiency and speed
